## Overview

The RWA Analytics Library is a Rust-based solution designed to facilitate access to and analysis of tokenized Real World Assets (RWA) data. It aims to provide developers and financial analysts with a robust set of tools for querying, aggregating, and analyzing data related to RWA tokens, enabling informed decision-making and insights into asset performance.

## Features

- **Data Retrieval**: Efficiently fetch tokenized RWA data from multiple sources.
- **Analytics Engine**: Perform complex analytics on RWA data, including trend analysis, performance metrics, and risk assessment.
- **Custom Queries**: Support for custom queries to filter and extract specific data points.
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) for RWA tokens.
- **Data Aggregation**: Aggregate data from various tokens to present comprehensive market insights.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for speed and efficiency, leveraging Rust's concurrency and safety features.
