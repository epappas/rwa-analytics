# RWA Analytics Library

## Overview

The RWA Analytics Library is a Rust-based solution designed to facilitate access to and analysis of tokenized Real World Assets (RWA) data. It aims to provide developers and financial analysts with a robust set of tools for querying, aggregating, and analyzing data related to RWA tokens, enabling informed decision-making and insights into asset performance.

## Features

- **Data Retrieval**: Efficiently fetch tokenized RWA data from multiple sources.
- **Analytics Engine**: Perform complex analytics on RWA data, including trend analysis, performance metrics, and risk assessment.
- **Custom Queries**: Support for custom queries to filter and extract specific data points.
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) for RWA tokens.
- **Data Aggregation**: Aggregate data from various tokens to present comprehensive market insights.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for speed and efficiency, leveraging Rust's concurrency and safety features.

## Architecture

The RWA Analytics Library is built around a modular architecture, with the following key components:

- **Data Fetcher**: Responsible for fetching RWA data from various sources, such as blockchain networks, data providers, and external APIs.
- **Data Processor**: Processes the raw data to extract relevant information, perform calculations, and generate insights.
- **Analytics Engine**: Provides a set of tools and algorithms for analyzing RWA data, including trend analysis, performance metrics, and risk assessment.
- **Query Engine**: Supports custom queries to filter and extract specific data points based on user-defined criteria.
- **Data Aggregator**: Aggregates data from multiple sources and tokens to present comprehensive market insights and performance metrics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.56.0 or later

### Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
rwa_analytics_lib = "0.1.0"
```

### Usage

Here's a quick example to get you started:

```rust
use rwa_analytics_lib::RwaAnalytics;

fn main() {
    let analytics = RwaAnalytics::new("your_api_key_here");
    let data = analytics.get_token_data("token_identifier_here");
    println!("{:?}", data);
}
```
